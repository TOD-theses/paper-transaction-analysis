## Notes

ML:
- definition mostly implicit through the dataset
- some tools only output "vulnerable" / "not vulnerable" => hard to benchmark for a single vulnerability, as we don't know if it found the TOD or something else
- GPTLens has no consistent output format (not even a list of vulnerabilities it supports)

Multi-Contract:
- Nyx
- TODO: more?

IcyChecker:
- does it need to be already deployed with existing transactions?
