# Dataset bias

The set of contracts is biased to those which were actually deployed to the blockchain. Some of them may have already been tested with the detection tools, so naturally, contracts that are currently not detectable by these tools will be favored (If a tool flags something as vulnerable, it will hopefully get fixed before being deployed, so this success case won't enter our dataset).
