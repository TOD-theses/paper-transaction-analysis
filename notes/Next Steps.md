### Tasks
Done so far:
- POC attack mining via RPC
- POC trace analysis (without exact TOD definitions and labels)
- trace generation locally

TODO:
- exact definitions of TOD types and labels
- implement trace analysis for TOD types and labels
- refine attack mining
- implement orchestrator: connect attack mining and trace analysis
- implement MRE based on TOD-source -> TOD-sink
- implement deduplication and/or grouping of attacks
- benchmark TOD detection tools
