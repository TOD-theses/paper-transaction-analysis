# Troubleshooting

Running the example with the replaced API key:

Works until 5_. Not specific to 5 though, eg when skipping the first two it continues further. Or when introducing a 2 min delay between the txs it only goes up to 3.

Looking at the debugger it stops at ethers_providers  `JsonRpcClient.request`:

```
let res = self.client.post(self.url.as_ref()).json(&payload).send().await?;
```

Looking at the debugging state, this tries to make a "eth_getStorageAt" RPC call, called by ethersdb.storage_ref.
